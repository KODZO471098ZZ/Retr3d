{"name":"E Waste 3D Printer","tagline":"Another Man's Trash is Another's 3D Printer","body":"# E-Waste 3D Printer\r\nIn 2009, discarded TVs, computers, peripherals (including printers, scanners, fax machines) mice, keyboards, and cell phones totaled about 2.37 million short tons. Most of our e-waste ends up in landfills—mostly in the developing world—where toxic metals leach into the environment. This open source project aims to convert some of that e-waste into usable 3D printers. \r\n## Software\r\nE-Waste 3D Printer uses python and FreeCAD to 3D model printable parts for the construction of more 3D printers. Through globalVars.py dimensions of procured e-waste are turned into customized 3D models. E-Waste 3D Printer's software depends on FreeCAD's python scripting API. FreeCAD can be found [here](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Download \"Download FreeCAD\").\r\n## Configuration\r\nAll of the customisable options can be configured [here.](https://cdn.rawgit.com/masterperson40/ewaste3Dprinter/master/config_generator/index.html) After generating your configuration file make sure to replace the original \"globalVars.py file with the newly generated one.\r\n## Tests\r\nTo begin creating a printer from the default options, open FreeCAD. Next, select “Macros ...” from the “Macro” menu. \r\n![Select \"Macros ...\"](https://github.com/masterperson40/ewaste3Dprinter/raw/master/docs/picture1.png)\r\nNext, select the folder where “makePrinter.py” is stored. \r\n![Select \"makePrinter.py\"](https://github.com/masterperson40/ewaste3Dprinter/raw/master/docs/picture2.png)\r\nFinally, select “makePrinter.py” for the available options. After that, hit “Execute” to create a printer.\r\n![Hit \"Execute\"](https://github.com/masterperson40/ewaste3Dprinter/raw/master/docs/picture3.png)\r\nIf everything was installed correctly, you should now have something that looks like this:\r\n![printer](https://github.com/masterperson40/ewaste3Dprinter/raw/master/docs/picture4.png)\r\nRemember, it might take a while for your printer to be modeled. Please be patient. \r\n## Plate\r\nTo facilitate an efficient workflow, E-Waste 3D Printer can interface with [Plater](https://github.com/RobotsWar/Plater) to arrange parts in an extremely efficient manner. Make sure to put the appropriate version of plater in the \"plater\" folder. (Eg. plater.exe, plater.dmg, or plater)\r\n![Plater](https://github.com/masterperson40/ewaste3Dprinter/raw/master/docs/picture5.png)\\\r\n## Slic3r Integration\r\nE-Waste 3D Printer can also interface with [Slic3r](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r) to slice parts automatically. After installing the dependencies, make sure to put the appropriate version of Slic3r in the \"Slic3r\" folder. (Eg. slic3r.exe, slic3r.dmg, or slic3r)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
